# [QUICKSTART] Î» Deploy your bot to a "serverless" AWS Lambda Function

- This example uses the **[Serverless Stack (SST)](https://serverless-stack.com/)** toolchain for provisioning, deployment of infrastructure.

- SST is built on top of a version **[AWS Cloud Development Kit (cdk)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)** and makes it possible to express your infrastructure needs as spec/code. SST is definitely not required, but is the quickest route to a serverless deployment.

- SpeedyBot has been built with serverless in mind from the beginning-- serverless infrastructure is "asleep" until you need it. Start-up times are generally fast enough to interact with the chat client withot timing out. Check out the **[Worker sample](https://speedybot.js.org/examples/worker/README)** for a fast-loading V8 Isolate without the overhead of a container

## 1) Fetch repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/valgaze/speedybot
cd speedybot
cd examples/lambda
npm install
```

Note: The actual code of the agent located in **packages/functions/src/settings/bot.ts** and lamba code is available **packages/functions/src/lambda.ts**

## 2) Set your bot access token

- If you have an existing bot, get its token here: **[https://developer.webex.com/my-apps](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps)**

- If you don't have a bot, create one and save the token from here: **[https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/new/bot](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/new/bot)**

- Create a `.env` file like **[.env.example](./.env.example)**

```sh
WEBHOOK_SECRET=__REPLACE__ME__
BOT_TOKEN=__REPLACE__ME__
```

Note: WEBHOOK_SECRET is up to you, incoming requests will be hashed with it, if the hash is present on the incoming request & `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is present, the lambda will attempt to validate the request. If it fails to match the request will be rejected

Note: The `.env` file musts never be aded to source control (and there are may ways to supply sensitive data to lambda functions with SST)

## 3) Set up your AWS credentials on your machine

Note: You'll need an AWS account that has authorization/billing to create lambda functions

3a. Setup IAM here: https://sst.dev/chapters/create-an-iam-user.html

3b. Setup AWS CLI: https://sst.dev/chapters/configure-the-aws-cli.html

## 4) Deploy your bot and obtain its public URL

Run this command from the project directory:

```
npm run deploy
```

If deployment is successful, you should find that your url that looks something like this: https://abcd123456.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

## 5) Register your webhooks

- Right now if you try to interact with your "deployed" agent nothing happens, nobody is "home" to answer the knock at the door

- Make a note of the URL of the deployed function and append /speedybot on the end , ex https://abcd123456.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/speedybot

- Hop on over to the **[SpeedyBot Garage (https://speedybot.js.org/garage)](https://speedybot.js.org/garage)**, enter your access token, select the Webhooks tab, and then **Add New Webhook** and add your lambdas's URL + `/speedybot` and (optionally) a webhook secret

Note:
This uses SST but any deployment mechanism/structure you prefer works fine

Note: This SST configuration is setup to capture incoming WebEx requests on the `/speedybot` route, you can change any/all the behavior in **[the stack config](./stacks/MyStack.ts)**

## 6) Take it for a spin

- After connecting webhooks, take it for a spin

## 7) Local Dev

SST has a cool feature where you can develop your lambda/bot code locally but reach real AWS services.

Install dependencies in **packages/functions/src** and run `npm install` and you can run the following command for live-reload:

```
npm run dev
```
