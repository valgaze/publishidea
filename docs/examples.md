## Examples

SpeedyBot has several "batteries-included" examples that show how to deploy Speedybot on a variety of platforms/services. It doesn't matter if it's Serverless-less/Server-ful, websockets or whatever-- it can probably run Speedybot. There's no "best" infrastructure solution but rather choices/options depending on your setup and particular requirements.

SpeedyBot makes it easy to focus on that parts that matter-- your content + integrations and you do all of that from a simple `bot.ts` file.
