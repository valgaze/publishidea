## Why SpeedyBot

tl;dr: SpeedyBot isn't a product or "platform" or anything fancy, but it's everything you (it can be 1 person) to cut the BS and build somethign and connect it to other services right now

## Why

[[image of lifeguard tower in El Porto or 28th Street, even use a DallE one]]

SpeedyBot is like kicking a volleyball back to people

We shouldn't be building chat-ui's

You may need some rad functionality, you should be able to do ENOUGH just with this

Focus on content, FEATURES, integartion what the agent can do on the user's behalf that's useful + valuable

# Infra changed too

Just throw it on a worker

Cheap/near-free ephemeral compute (not just lambdas) but discard the whole container runtime entirely

The paradigm of how ppl build bots is changed too

It's not just regexs and dumb "handlers"-- it's about connecting to Voiceflow, using docs + knowledge, imprtant

## why webex

You get files, security, auth, users, it's a "serious"/enterprise'y platform

# "chatbots" were stupid

Still need Bozo bots

- want to alert when awebhook comes in? ok fine

But htat's harder than it should be to build

## Friendly and easy for existing devs

- More JS devs

- (find notes from that dude's talk)

## bozo-bots

Still room for bozo bots

## Goal

Get it FedRAMP approved
Get it
